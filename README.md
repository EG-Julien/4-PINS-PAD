# 4-PINS-PAD
Use an 8 pins matrix keyboard with only 4 analogic pins

#How to set-up ?

You will need :
  - 4 100K resistors *This resistors are not required, they are here to force the analog pins to 0 vlots.*
  - 3 10K resistors
  - 2 22K resistors
  - 1 2.2K resistors
  
Now you have to make 3 tension divider bridge. Like this :

This tension divider bridge will create 4 tension step (*something around 5V, 3V, 2V and 1V*).

Upload the program and have fun !
